# Colorectal Cancer Risk & Survival Analysis (Python)

## Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations manage large volumes of colorectal cancer patient data, yet identifying high-risk patients and understanding the factors that influence survival outcomes remains challenging without structured analysis. The absence of data-driven insights can limit effective treatment prioritization, early intervention, and outcome-focused decision-making.

This project addresses this challenge by analyzing colorectal cancer patient data to uncover key risk factors and survival patterns that can support informed healthcare and analytical decisions.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze colorectal cancer patient data and identify demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors that influence patient survival outcomes. The analysis focuses on translating raw data into meaningful insights that can assist healthcare stakeholders in risk stratification and decision-making.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of anonymized colorectal cancer patient records, including:
- Patient demographics
- Medical and lifestyle risk factors
- Clinical indicators
- Survival status and outcomes

The data was explored to understand survival distributions and risk patterns across different patient groups.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature-based risk interpretation

---

## Data Preparation
Key preprocessing steps included:
- Validation of missing values and overall data consistency
- Encoding of categorical variables for analytical use
- Feature selection based on relevance to survival outcomes
- Removal of redundant or non-informative attributes

These steps ensured accurate, interpretable, and reliable analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory analysis focused on:
- Survival status distribution across age groups
- Impact of clinical history and lifestyle factors on survival
- Comparison between high-risk and low-risk patient profiles
- Identification of variables most strongly associated with survival outcomes

---

## Key Insights
- Patient age shows a strong association with survival probability
- Specific clinical and medical risk factors significantly influence survival outcomes
- Patients with multiple combined risk factors demonstrate lower survival rates
- A small subset of features drives a majority of variation in survival outcomes

---

## Healthcare & Business Insights
- Early identification of high-risk patient segments enables proactive clinical intervention
- Risk-based patient stratification supports improved treatment prioritization
- Data-driven insights can assist healthcare professionals in outcome-focused planning
- Analytical frameworks like this can support population-level health monitoring initiatives
